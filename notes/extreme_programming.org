#+title: Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is an Agile software development framework that is characterized by practices intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.

Some of the key principles and practices of XP include:
- *Rapid Feedback Loops*: XP emphasizes getting rapid feedback from customers and end-users through practices like pair programming, continuous integration, and automated testing.
- *Iterative and Incremental Development*: XP teams work in short iterations, delivering working software frequently and incorporating customer feedback along the way.
- *Simple Design*: XP encourages teams to keep the design of the software as simple as possible, only adding complexity when it's needed.
- *Continuous Refactoring*: XP practitioners regularly refactor the codebase to improve its structure and maintainability without changing its external behavior.
- *Collective Code Ownership*: In XP, the entire team shares responsibility for the entire codebase, rather than individual developers "owning" specific modules or components.
- *Test-Driven Development (TDD)*: As mentioned earlier, TDD is a core XP practice where developers write automated tests before writing the actual implementation code.
- *Pair Programming*: XP teams typically practice pair programming, where two developers work together on the same computer, coding, reviewing, and learning from each other.

XP is known for its emphasis on feedback, communication, simplicity, and courage - empowering developers to continually improve the software and respond to change.
