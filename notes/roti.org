#+title: ROTI

ROTI, for "Return On Time Invested", is a feedback technique used to evaluate the effectiveness and value of meetings.

* How?

At the meeting's end, ask participants to rate the session from 1-5. Optionally but recommanded, gather brief comments on the ratings. Use feedback to improve future meetings.

Here's what each level typically means:
1. Waste of Time - The meeting provided no value
2. Not Very Valuable - Limited value, could have been handled differently
3. Somewhat Valuable - Had some useful elements but could be improved
4. Good Use of Time - Provided clear value to participants
5. Very Valuable - Exceptional value, achieved all objectives effectively

* Why?

- Gauge meeting effectiveness
- Identify areas for improvement
- Ensure respect for participants' time
- Encourage better meeting planning and facilitation

* Best practices

- Keep it quick (usually 1-2 minutes)
- Encourage honest feedback
- Act on the feedback received
- Track ROTI over time to identify trends
